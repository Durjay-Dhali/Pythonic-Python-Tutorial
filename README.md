# Python-Tutorial
Learn Python! Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
This tutorial will help you learn this useful language: it's a programming guide for non-programmers. 

I attempted to apply the Python philosophy of writing code to writing this tutorial:
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
